Overview
==========================

This library allows you to call the LSF APIs from Perl. The wrapper is created
by using xsubpp.

This is an IBM Spectrum Computing fork of the original LSF-Batch-0.06 APIs,
which can be found at http://search.cpan.org/~lsfisv/.

IBM Spectrum Computing provides formal support for this software 
to entitled clients via the normal IBM support channels.


==========================

Before compiling the library, set LSF environment variables.

To compile and install the library, go to the source directory
and run the following commands:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
