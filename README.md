# IBM Spectrum LSF Perl API

These perl modules allow customers to submit and control jobs and obtain status of queues, hosts and other LSF attributes from within perl directly.  They work with various versions of LSF and are maintained by LSF developement, though we take contributions from the Open Source community.

If you plan or would like to contribute to the library, you must follow the DCO process in the attached [DCO Readme file](https://github.com/IBMSpectrumComputing/platform-python-lsf-api/blob/master/IBMDCO.md) in the root of this repository.  It essentially requires you to provide a Sign Off line in the notes of your pull request stating that the work is clear of infinging work by others.  Again, for more details, please see the DCO Readme file.

## Release Information

Each of the LSF-Base and LSF-Batch repositories include their own separate release information.  Please see those repositories README.md files for more information

These perl modules allow you to call the LSF APIs directly through perl.  [You can find more information and usage notes here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/New%20IBM%20Platform%20LSF%20Wiki/page/Integrations%2C%20APIs%2C%20and%20samples). 

You are encouraged to contribute your own perl module enhancements to the Open Source LSF APIs for perl, and you may find some examples in [IBM Platform LSF Wiki](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/New%20IBM%20Platform%20LSF%20Wiki/page/Using%20the%20Python%20wrapper%20for%20LSF%20API).

IBM provides formal support for this software to entitled clients via the normal IBM support channels.
